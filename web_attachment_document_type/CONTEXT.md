# Web Attachment Document Type

Odoo web enhancement that adds two things to the standard `many2many_binary` attachment
widget:

1. **Drag & drop** file upload — always on, for every place in Odoo that uses
   `many2many_binary`.
2. **Document Type classification** — an optional Many2one on `ir.attachment` picking
   from a shared taxonomy (`ir.attachment.document.type`). Which doctypes appear on
   which forms is configured per model in a Mapping table
   (`ir.attachment.document.type.rel`) that also holds the display `sequence`. The
   doctype UI (dropdown + badge) shows up only on forms whose `res_model` has at least
   one Mapping.

There is no custom widget name to remember and no per-consumer JS. A consumer module
that wants classification ships a `ir.attachment.document.type.config` per parent model
with its Mapping lines inline (`ir.attachment.document.type.rel` via `line_ids`), plus
any doctype masters (`ir.attachment.document.type`) it needs that aren't already in the
shared taxonomy.

## Language

**Document Type**: A record in `ir.attachment.document.type` — the master name for a
"kind" of attachment (Contract, Receipt, TOR, etc.). Holds only its `name` and `active`
flag; scope and ordering are on the Mappings that point to it, not on the doctype
itself. _Avoid_: classifier (implementation-level jargon), metadata (too broad),
category (overloaded in Odoo), attachment type (ambiguous with MIME type).

**Model Config**: A row in `ir.attachment.document.type.config` — one per parent model
that participates in doctype classification. Holds `res_model_id` and the ordered
`line_ids` (see Mapping). Uniqueness is enforced so a model has at most one Config. This
is what users create/edit from Settings — "New" makes a Config, not a new `ir.model`, so
the tree can safely use `create="true"` without Studio-style side effects.

**Mapping**: A line inside a Config (row in `ir.attachment.document.type.rel`) — the
pairing of a `Document Type` with a `sequence`, scoped to the Config's model via
`config_id`. There is at most one Mapping per (config, doctype) pair (SQL unique). A
doctype may appear in zero or more Configs; a Config may hold zero or more Mappings.
_Avoid_: link (too generic), assignment (implies workflow), scope (derived from
Configs + Mappings, not stored on the doctype).

**Scope (of a Document Type)**: The set of Models a doctype is offered on, derived from
its inbound Mappings. Not a stored field — read via the widget's query on the Mapping
table filtered by `res_model_name`.

**Attached-to Model** (or _parent model_): The `res_model` of an `ir.attachment` row —
the model of the record the file is attached to (e.g., `kris.project`,
`purchase.request`, `account.move`).

**Base Widget** vs **Patched Widget**: Base = the stock `Many2ManyBinaryField` from
`@web/views/fields/many2many_binary/`. Patched = the same class after
`web_attachment_document_type` has applied its `patch()` — everywhere in Odoo that uses
`widget="many2many_binary"` sees the patched behaviour.

**Consumer Module**: Any Odoo module that references doctypes from the shared
`ir.attachment.document.type` taxonomy and ships `ir.attachment.document.type.rel`
records (the Mappings that pin those doctypes to its own models) plus an
`ir.attachment.document.type.config` per model, via data XML. A consumer _may_ create
new doctype master records with `noupdate="1"` but should first check whether an
existing xmlid (in `web_attachment_document_type` or another consumer) already covers
the concept — the taxonomy is shared and duplicate names are blocked at the DB level
(`unique(name)` on `ir.attachment.document.type`). Consumers hold no Python or JS
related to the widget. First consumers: `kris_project` and `purchase_request_kmitl`.

## Rules of the game

- **Doctype is always optional.** `ir.attachment.document_type_id` is declared
  `required=False` at base. Files coming in through any path (widget Attach button, drag
  & drop, mail chatter, API, import) are accepted with `document_type_id = NULL`. The
  badge displays "- Set type -" for those, and the user can set the value later by
  clicking the badge.
- **Business rule "must have doctype" is a consumer concern.** If a workflow needs every
  attachment classified before a state transition (e.g. `kris.project.action_confirm`),
  the consumer writes an `@api.constrains` or a check in the transition method that
  raises `UserError` when `attachment_ids.filtered(lambda a: not a.document_type_id)` is
  non-empty. Base does not enforce.
- **Scope is data — one Config per model, one Mapping per doctype.** To offer doctypes
  on a new parent model, ship (or add via UI) a Config
  (`ir.attachment.document.type.config`) with inline Mappings referencing the doctype
  master records. **New** on the Config tree creates a Config — no ir.model rows are
  ever created from the UI.
- **Two menus, two purposes.** Settings → Technical → Parameters exposes two menus:
  - **Document Types** — master taxonomy CRUD (create/rename/archive/delete). The action
    opens with `active_test: False` so archived doctypes are visible for un-archiving.
    Deletion is guarded by `ondelete="restrict"` on `ir.attachment.document_type_id` —
    Postgres blocks unlink of a doctype in use by any attachment.
  - **Attachment Doctypes** — model-Config: which doctypes are offered on which parent
    model, in what order. The doctype m2o inside each Config's Mapping tree is locked to
    select-only (`no_create`, `no_create_edit`, `no_open`) so admins can't accidentally
    spawn typo'd master rows from this form; new doctypes must be created explicitly
    from the **Document Types** menu first.
- **Sequence lives on the Mapping, not on the Doctype.** The same doctype can appear in
  a different position under different models.
- **UI is conditional.** A form whose `res_model` has zero doctypes mapped to it renders
  the widget unchanged from Odoo standard — no badge, no dropdown, no dialog on Attach.
  It does still get drag & drop (unconditional).
- **Post-hoc edit via clickable badge.** The Document Type badge next to each
  attachment's caption is itself the affordance — blue badge with the doctype name if
  set, yellow "- Set type -" badge if not. Clicking opens a dialog with the doctype
  dropdown pre-populated. Save writes `document_type_id` via `orm.write`; Cancel closes.
  The attachment record itself and its id are preserved throughout.
- **Drag & drop is always on.** All 12 Odoo core usages of `many2many_binary` (mail
  composer, hr leaves, account invoice send, survey, etc.) and 17 in this repo
  (disbursement, advance_payment, agx_approval, …) get drag & drop for free — pure UX
  enhancement, no behavioural change.
- **Attach button opens a dialog when doctypes exist.** On a `res_model` that has at
  least one Mapping, clicking Attach opens `AttachmentDocumentTypeDialog` with a file
  input (drag-drop capable) plus a Document Type dropdown — user picks the doctype at
  upload time and uploads via `/web/binary/upload_attachment`. On a `res_model` with
  zero Mappings, Attach falls through to Odoo's standard `FileInput` → OS picker.
- **Filenames open in a new tab, not download.** `getUrl` returns `?download=false`, the
  anchor's `download` attribute is stripped, and `target="_blank"` is added. Applies to
  every `many2many_binary` in the system, not only models with doctype mappings.
  Right-click → _Save link as…_ still triggers a download.
- **`document_type_id` is fetched reactively.** Added to
  `Many2ManyBinaryField.fieldsToFetch` at patch time, so the badge updates immediately
  when a user edits it — no full-form reload needed.
- **Chatter tracking on doctype change runs with sudo.** `ir.attachment.write` posts a
  "Document Type: old → new" message on the parent's chatter using `sudo()` on the
  parent browse. This means a user who can write an attachment always leaves a trail,
  even if they don't have read access to the parent record. Intentional:
  attachment-level writes are already permitted by policy, and the chatter trail is more
  valuable than the (rare) information-leak concern of a mysterious author appearing on
  chatter.

## Manual verification checklist

Test end-to-end after touching the patch or the taxonomy model:

1. Install `web_attachment_document_type`, upgrade `kris_project` and
   `purchase_request_kmitl`.
2. Open a `kris.project` form → attachment tab uses the standard `many2many_binary`:
   - Drag a file over the card list → dashed outline overlay "Drop files to attach"
     appears → release → file uploads → row appears with a yellow "- Set type -" badge.
   - Click the badge → dialog with a Document Type dropdown showing kris_project's
     doctypes (สัญญา / จัดซื้อจัดจ้าง / เอกสารเบิกจ่ายและใบเสร็จ) → pick a value → Save
     → badge turns blue with the doctype name.
3. Open a `purchase.request` form → same behaviour but the dropdown lists TOR /
   Quotation / Etc.
4. Open a vendor bill (`account.move`) or any other form with `many2many_binary` and no
   doctypes mapped → drag & drop still works, but there is **no** badge, **no**
   dropdown, **no** dialog on Attach — widget looks exactly like Odoo standard.
5. Reload a form after tagging → badges still show. This confirms `document_type_id` is
   in `fieldsToFetch`.
6. Settings > Technical > Parameters:
   - **Document Types** → New → ตั้งชื่อ doctype ใหม่ (e.g. `Warranty`) → Save. Doctype
     master ปรากฏในลิสต์.
   - **Attachment Doctypes** → New → pick `Model` = `purchase.order`, add a Mapping line
     → เลือก doctype จาก dropdown (quick-create ถูกบล็อค — ต้องมาสร้างที่ Document Types
     ก่อน), set `Sequence` → **Save**. เปิด PO form → dropdown + badge ปรากฏทันที (order
     ตาม sequence), ไม่ต้อง JS reload. Tree รายชื่อ Config (1 row = 1 model)
     และแสดงเฉพาะ model ที่มี Config เท่านั้น.
7. Chatter D&D bug (see commit `97af33e`) still works: dragging over a form with a
   chatter and dropping on the attachment widget does not leave the chatter drop overlay
   stuck.
8. Upload via mail chatter → attachment appears in the widget list with a yellow "- Set
   type -" badge → click the badge to set doctype.
9. Consumer constraint enforcement: if `kris.project.action_confirm` is wired to check
   `attachment_ids` doctypes, confirming a project that has an unclassified attachment
   raises `UserError` — implement this only where the workflow actually needs it, not by
   default.
