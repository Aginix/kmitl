# Procurement Plan — Disbursement

Makes a [Procurement Plan](../procurement_plan/CONTEXT.md) track its **actual**
disbursement against its **planned** installments. Tracking only — the plan
authors no disbursement of its own; the money still goes out through the
purchase order and its [Disbursement Request](../disbursement/CONTEXT.md).

## Language

**Installment ↔ Disbursement link (การผูกงวดกับใบขอเบิก)**:
The manual pointer from one งวด (`procurement.plan.payment`) to the single
`disbursement.request` that pays it. Authored on the plan's งวด line — never on
the disbursement request, which stays operational under the purchase order. One
งวด points to one DR; the picker only offers DRs that draw this plan's
reservation down.
_Avoid_: assignment, allocation

**Actual disbursed (เบิกจ่ายจริง)**:
The budget a งวด has really consumed = the linked DR's consumed amount, counted
only once the budget act has consumed it (the plan's reservation is drawn down
then). A linked DR whose budget is not consumed yet is *กำลังดำเนินการ* and
counts as zero.
_Avoid_: paid, spent, planned amount (that is the งวด's own `amount`)
